## Promotion Recommendation
- Decision: **do_not_promote**
- Reason: Selective canary has not yet cleared all promotion gates on new graded picks.

## Production Safety
- Default behavior remains OFF unless WNBA_ENABLE_SELECTIVE_FEATURE_SHADOW=1 or WNBA_ENABLE_SELECTIVE_FEATURE_CANARY=1 is set.
- Production model files, grading files, public board, and publish outputs are not written.
